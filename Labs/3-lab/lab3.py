def benchmark_random(num_exp, step_size, num_eqs, process, low=-100, hi=100):
    """Benchmark a process using random matrix equations.

    Parameters
    ----------
    num_exp : int
        The number of experiments to be run.
    step_size : int
        This value dictates the size of each experiment to run.  For
        example, if you run `10` experiments with step size `10`, then
        experiment `i` should use a matrix of size `(10 * i)` by `(10 * i)`
    num_eqs : int
        This value dictates the number of experiments that `process`
        needs to solve, if `num_eqs` is `100`, then the length of the
        vectors `bs` passed into `process` should be `100`.
    process
        The function to benchmark.  In this lab, it will be `solve`,
        `lu_solve`, or `inv_solve`, as defined in the lab spec.
    low : int, default=100
        The lowest value used for random number generation
    high : int, default=100
        One more than the highest value used for random number generation

    Returns
    -------
    tuple[np.ndarray, np.ndarry]
        The output `x_axis, y_axis` should be the `x_axis` of the
        experiment, which should be of the form:
            `np.array([1 * step_size, 2 * step_size,..., num_exp * step_size])`
        and `y_axis` should be the times it takes to run each experiment.

    Notes
    -----
    An experiment is comprised of the following:

    * Generate a random matrix `a` of the appropriate size with values
      between `low` and `high`.

    * Generate a list of vectors `bs` of the appropriate size, of
      length `num_eqs`.

    * Time `process(a, bs)`.  Be careful not to include the matrix
      generation as part of the timing.
